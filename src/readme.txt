To run my flask app, you'll need to do the following:
First save all files appropriatley in their right places, saving the templates
in the templates directory etc.

Second run the OnlineCatalogue.py file using pyton, once this is done use the
localhost URL localhost:5000/

Third once you're on the home page, you can use the navbar to navigate the
menus, on the display page, is everything stored on the database and displays
it on a bootstrap table.
